# Remote Profile Cleanup

This simple tool was developed to remotely delete one or more user profiles from a Microsoft Windows workstation or server. It is a HTA application developed in VBS, JavaScript, and HTML.

### Installing

Just copy the .HTA file anywhere on your system and run it.

### Usage

Enter a hostname into the input field at the top. Leaving the hostname blank will cause the tool to connect locally. Uncheck "Use Windows Integrated Authentication" if you want to supply a different username and password. All user profiles will be listed. Check the ones you want to remove and click Delete.
